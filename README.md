# Homework 1: Data Analysis Basics


## Problem

Obtain the CSV (comma separated variable) file containing the counts of
bicycles crossing the Fremont Bridge since 2012 (as described in
`https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Fremont-Bridge-Hourly-Bicycle-Counts-by-Month-Octo/65db-xm6k`).
Create a project directory with subdirectories for data and analysis, and
create a README file. Download the data from
`https://data.seattle.gov/api/views/65db-xm6k/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD` and
put it in the data directory. Create a Jupyter notebook to analyze these data.
In the notebook, complete the following:

1. Read the CSV file into a pandas dataframe (1pt)
2. Add columns to the dataframe containing:
  * The total (East + West) bicycle count (1pt)
  * The hour of the day (1pt)
  * The year (1pt)
3. Create a dataframe with the subset of data from the year 2016 (1pt)
4. Use pandas + matplotlib to plot the counts by hour. (i.e. hour of the day on the x-axis, total daily counts on the y-axis) (1pt)
5. Use pandas to determine what is (on average) the busiest hour of the day (1pt)

Note that we fully expect this analysis to cover some unfamiliar ground, and
require teaching yourself a bit about Python and/or the Pandas package. Part of
the intent of this assignment is to give you practice seeking help via the web,
which (in our experience) is an essential part of using any data science
tool. For example, if you type a question about Pandas into Google, youâ€™ll
often find an existing answer to your question or something similar on the
website StackOverflow.
